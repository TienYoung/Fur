# GPU Skinned Fur Instance Rendering

This Unity demo showcases an implementation of shell-based fur rendering using GPU instancing on skinned meshes. The project demonstrates how to render multiple fur shell layers in a single pass, while maintaining support for skeletal animation.

## Features

- GPU Instancing support for skinned meshes using `SkinnedMeshRenderer.GetVertexBuffer`
- Shell-based fur rendering in a single draw pass  
- Fully animated characters with bone skinning  
- Efficient rendering using Unity's `CommandBuffer.DrawProcedural` and custom shader logic

## Requirements

- Unity 2021.2.7f1
